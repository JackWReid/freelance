# Purebody Health

The site is built with Jekyll and Gulp. To get the site ready for development:

1. `gem install jekyll`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`

The site will be built into the `_site` folder.

## Ready For Deploy

Because the site is built to a set of static files, it can be deployed anywhere that will serve files publicly. To make a build that is ready to be deployed on a server aliased to "purebodyhealth.co.uk", run `npm run build`.
