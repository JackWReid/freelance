		<p>Have you ever met a star that fell to earth?</p>
		<p>Estelle is the brightest star in Hollywood. She is the shining light of the silver screen, her beauty is adored by all. But, with an empty heart, she is full of vanity, pride and selfishness. As her light begins to fade, this fallen star must learn, with a little help from a mysterious guide, what it is to truly love and be loved.</p>
		<p>This show is a premiere for Canvas Theatre, and marks the first collaboration between two exciting Cornish theatre makers, Rosanna Elliott and Ciaran Clarke.
