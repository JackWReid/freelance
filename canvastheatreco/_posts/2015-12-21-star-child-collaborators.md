[Casting for The Star Child](http://canvastheatre.co.uk/news/star-child-cast.html) has now been announced: Canvas Theatre are delighted to reveal that the cast for The Star Child will be comprised of Kate Cavendish and Catherine Lake.

Kate Cavendish recently graduated from Bristol Old Vic Theatre School where she was honoured with the 2015 Newton Blick Award for Versatility. Kate will be making her professional debut with Canvas’ The Star Child, and we expect to see great things from her in the future.  Catherine Lake can often been seen on Cornish stages, with Miracle Theatre, o-region, Near-Ta Theatre and Mundic Nation credits under her belt. As well as this wealth of experience, Cat trained at Central School of Speech and Drama; she is a wonderful actress, whom Canvas cannot wait to work with. We are also delighted to welcome two young but extremely talented actors to the fold in Louis King and Isaac King.

The show features an original musical score by [Ben Sutcliffe](http://canvastheatre.co.uk/artists) of the popular People’s String Foundation. Esteemed Cornish filmmaker Brett Harvey has also come on board. Using new technologies, The Star Child will feature some extra-special cameo appearances from the likes of Craig Johnson (Squashbox Theatre, Kneehigh Theatre) and Morgan Val Baker (WildWorks). Canvas aren’t revealing too much at this time to make sure it is a truly magical surprise, but these are sure to be a spectacular treat.

Supported by Arts Council England, Hall for Cornwall Arts Development, FEAST and The Poly, Canvas are excited to present their first production at Falmouth's home of innovation in both Art and Science.
