Since the success of The Star Child at the Poly we have been quietly busying away working on freelance projects.

Rosanna has been working for the National Theatre on their Connections programme and Ciaran has excitingly taken up a place at Falmouth University and will be commencing a PHD in Digital Theatre. He will stay involved with Canvas as an associate artist and Rosanna will be taking Canvas plans forward.

This years focus is going to be on developing new writing and creating a collective of artists and collaborators.

There are some exciting projects to be announced soon, please follow us on Facebook and Twitter for all the information as they develop and get in touch if you're interested in making work with us in the South West by contacting [rosanna@canvastheatre.co.uk](mailto:rosanna@canvastheatre.co.uk).
