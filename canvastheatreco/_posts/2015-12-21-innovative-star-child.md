The Star Child will see The Poly in Falmouth revisit it͛s fascinating 175 year history as a driving force behind innovation, and the relationship between culture and science.

Inspired by the Golden Age of Hollywood, The Star Child is an enchanting family friendly show that follows Estelle, a star of the silver screen who͛s light is beginning to fade. Using ground-breaking projection-mapping techniques and a script that features contributions from an astrophysicist, Canvas Theatre have created a show that is both heart-warmingly engaging and theatrically inventive.
The show is set in the 1930s 'talkie' period when the very first films with synchronised sound hit cinemas across the world. Incredibly, The Poly was one of these early cinemas where people would gather to see if this new film craze was as impressive as it was built up to be. Fast forward eighty years and people will be sitting back on the red velvet seats to experience a similar story with a very fresh approach that is sure to remind the audience that they are actually still in the 21st century.

This show is a premiere for Canvas Theatre, and marks the first collaboration between two exciting Cornish theatre makers, Rosanna Elliott and Ciaran Clarke.

Says The Poly: 'The Poly has a long history of film, theatre and technology, and we're very excited to see this new production bringing all that together with such a talented team behind it'.

Supported by Arts Council England, Hall for Cornwall Arts Development and The Poly, Canvas are excited to present their first production at Falmouth's home of innovation in both Art and Science.

The Star Child runs from 27th December to 3rd January excluding New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. Matinee performance on 2nd January.
