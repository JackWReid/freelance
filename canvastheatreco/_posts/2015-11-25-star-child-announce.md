Announcing our first production, The Star Child, coming to The Poly, Falmouth this Christmas.

We are very excited to announce that out first ever show will be called The Star Child and will be performed at The Poly, Falmouth this December.

Have you ever met a star that fell to Earth?

Estelle is the brightest star in Hollywood. She is the shining light of the silver screen, her beauty is adored by all. But, with an empty heart, she is full of vanity, pride and selfishness. As her light begins to fade, this fallen star must learn, with a little help from a mysterious guide, what it is to truly love and be loved.

Using innovative projection mapping technology and working with a magical theatre designer, we have a bold and experimental idea for our set design to inform and lift our story of our play. The most exciting thing is that this is all happening in a theatre which was originally built for a meeting of art and science; “The Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society (known affectionately as ‘the Poly’) has been encouraging innovation and culture for over 175 years” (see http://thepoly.org/about-us/our-history/). We couldn’t ask for a more perfect setting to explore our first foray into new theatre technology, as well as our inaugural production.

Basing The Star Child on Oscar Wilde’s short story of the same name, we want to update and adapt this classic story to better echo this spirit of science in art. To this end, we have been consulting with an Astrophysicist, who has been educating us on all things star-shaped.

We have spent the last few weeks writing, although we are expecting to devise some of the play once we get into rehearsals. This is partly because we enjoy working in an ensemble, where every member of the company has an ownership of the narrative and characters, and also, because of  our desire to let the technical aspects of the production unfold organically with the piece. We want to keep the spontaneity of the piece, even though we are using a device that require precise timing. We need to allow for maximum experimentation, but with the best possible creative outcome.

We have been holding auditions for the show and were delighted with the overwhelming response to the casting call from both near and far. We have so enjoyed meeting so many talented actors and fascinating minds and the decision was difficult. We are delighted with the actors we have cast and will be announcing them shortly...
